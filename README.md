# Deep Learning for Visual Computing - Assignment Submission

This repository contains the assignment submission for the "Deep Learning for Visual Computing" course during my M.Sc. studies in Computer Science at Humboldt University. The assignment focuses on implementing and comparing different deep learning models to solve visual computing tasks.

## Overview

The project involves training and evaluating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the MNIST dataset. The main objectives are to understand the fundamentals of CNN architectures and to explore the impact of different training configurations and optimizations on model performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: MNIST

## Installation

To set up the project environment to run the experiments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ``` git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/deep-learning-visual-computing.git```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ``` -pip install torch torchvision matplotlib```

## Running the Code
To execute the training and testing of the models, run the following command from the root directory of the project:
python train_test_model.py
This script will train the model and output the performance metrics such as training loss and test accuracy.
## Results
The experiments conducted in Exercises 1.1 and 1.2 demonstrate the capability of the CNN models to achieve high accuracy on the MNIST test set. Detailed performance metrics can be found in the results directory.
## Conclusion

This assignment helped in gaining practical experience with applying deep learning techniques in visual computing tasks. The analysis of different training configurations provided insights into the dynamics of model training and optimization.
